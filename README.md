### Exploratory data analysis and clustering using pytorch

- **[Dataset from Kaggle - histopathologic cancer detect](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection)**

#### Task performed

- Dataset size and class distribution
- Perform some sanity checks

  - Checking for corrupted files
  - File typing check
  - Checking image channels

- Visualizing the dataset
- Visualizing the distribution of channel pixels by class
- Identifying very dark and very light images and removing them
- Identifying duplicates in our data
- Transforming the images into a Feature Matrix
- Using KMeans to cluster our images
